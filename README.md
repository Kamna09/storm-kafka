## Storm-Kafka

A beautiful marriage between [Storm](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm) and [Kafka](http://incubator.apache.org/kafka). Seriously though, this library will let you use Kafka as a spout within Storm. It is based on the [storm-kestrel](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-kestrel) spout since they basically do the same thing, just with different message brokers.
